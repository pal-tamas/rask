description: Build or change a Rask.Ui component so it looks and behaves EXACTLY like its Flux UI (fluxui.dev) counterpart. Use for every component of the Flux rebuild — a new `Ui.*` component, replacing a daisyUI-drawn one, or fixing a parity difference. Measures Flux's live docs, writes the C# component from the measurements, proves parity with scripts/flux/parity.mjs, converts call sites, and deletes the daisy component it replaces.

# flux-component — one Flux UI component, exactly

Rask.Ui mirrors Flux UI: Flux's catalogue (51 components, 199 parts), Flux's names, Flux's look and
behaviour **to the pixel and to the keypress**. daisyUI is being removed component by component.

## The line that is never crossed
`livewire/flux` on GitHub is **proprietary** and its terms forbid derivatives in open source. Rask is
MIT. **Never open, read or copy that repository's Blade, CSS or JS.** Everything comes from the
PUBLIC docs site: its markdown (`https://fluxui.dev/components/<slug>.md`, index at `/llms.txt`) and
its live rendered examples, which `scripts/flux/measure.mjs` measures. Class strings are written from
the measurements, never transcribed from a page's `class` attributes.

## 1. Read and measure
```bash
curl -sS https://fluxui.dev/components/<slug>.md          # examples + the Reference section
node scripts/flux/measure.mjs artifacts/flux-parity/flux components/<slug>
```
`measurements.json` holds, per example and per scheme (light, dark), every node's box and computed
styles, its `::before`/`::after`, and what `:hover`, `:active` and `:focus-visible` change. PNGs of
each example sit beside it — look at them. Flux is Tailwind v4 on the default palette, so a measured
colour IS a Tailwind colour: `oklch(0.274 0.006 286.033)` is `zinc-800`, `rgba(0,0,0,.05) 0 1px 2px` is
`shadow-xs`. Name every value before writing a class. Every detail counts: a bottom border one shade
darker, an inset highlight, 12px on the icon side and 16px on the other.

Behaviour is measured too: open the page, use the component with keyboard and pointer (Playwright via
`scripts/flux/lib.mjs`'s `chromium()`), and write down what each key does before implementing it.

## 2. Write the component
**Nothing beyond Flux** — the owner, 2026-10-07: *"ne csináljunk ilyen kiegészítéseket"*. A component carries
exactly Flux's props, values, attributes and behaviour: no extra prop, no extra ARIA, no convenience step, no
wider range, however reasonable. The only non-Flux surface is the Rask TRANSLATION of a Livewire / Alpine /
PHP mechanism — `Bind`/`Value` for `wire:model`, a `Callback` for an event or `wire:click`, `RouteUrl? Href`
with client-side navigation for a link, a `Toast`-style facade for a `Flux::…()` call — plus `Class`, which
every Flux component takes. Same spirit, 2026-10-06: Flux stops no animation under reduced motion, and
neither does the kit. (A `Translations` table in `FluxConformanceTests`, naming each non-Flux property and
why, is to be the gate for this; it is NOT written yet — see "Open work" at the end.)

- **File and type:** `src/Rask.Ui/Ui<Name>.cs`, `public sealed partial class Ui<Name>`; a part is
  `Ui<Parent><Part>` (`flux:button.group` → `UiButtonGroup`, reached as `Ui.ButtonGroup`).
- **Props are Flux's**, one property per documented prop: `icon:trailing` → `IconTrailing`,
  `tooltip:position` → `TooltipPosition`. Optional props are nullable; `tests/Rask.Ui.Tests/Flux/flux.snapshot.json`
  is the list.
- **One enum per component** for a prop's values, nested in `Ui` (`src/Rask.Ui/Ui.<Name>.cs`):
  `Ui.ButtonVariant { Outline, Primary, Filled, Danger, Ghost, Subtle }`, FIRST member = Flux's default.
  The chain generator turns each member into a step (`Ui.Button.Primary.Sm.Blue`) for an enum of up to
  24 members, so every `Ui.Color` prop has its hues as steps. Shared across components:
  `Ui.Color` (ONE file, `Ui.Color.cs`: Tailwind's 17 chromatic hues in its order, then Slate, Gray, Zinc,
  Neutral, Stone — a component whose Flux prop has no neutrals draws a neutral as its default, as `UiText`
  does), `Ui.IconName`, `Ui.IconVariant`, `Ui.Position`, `Ui.Align`, `Ui.Inset` (flags). A member named like
  an inherited HTML tag entry (`Strong`, `Desc`, `Button`, `A`, `Div`, `Text`, `Search`, `Time`) gets a step
  that cannot be called (CS0176): write `.Variant(Ui.TextVariant.Strong)`, `.As(Ui.ButtonAs.A)` there. Known
  generator limit, not fixed.
- **Rask's own idiom where Flux's is Livewire's:** `wire:model` → `Bind`/`Value` (see
  `docs/building-form-controls.md`); an event → a non-nullable `Callback`/`Callback<T>`; a link →
  `RouteUrl? Href`; a slot → children (the indexer) or a `Component?` property for a named slot.
- **Marker:** the root writes `data-ui-<part>` where Flux writes `data-flux-<part>` (`data-ui-button`,
  `data-ui-button-group`), bare, through the ONE helper: `private static readonly UiPartMarker Marker =
  new("ui-button");` and `ResolveData() => Marker.With(Data)` (`With(Data, "color", name)` for one more
  attribute; `new("slot", "text")` for a valued one). The parity tool pairs nodes by it. Write only the
  `data-ui-*` attributes Flux writes: every one is a marker to the tool.
- **Element:** where Flux renders a custom element (`<ui-field>`, `<ui-label>`, `<ui-progress>`,
  `<ui-table-scroll-area>`, `<ui-disclosure>`), write the NATIVE element with the same semantics and no
  script (`<div>`, `<label for>`, `<div role="progressbar">`, `<details>`) and add the pair to `NATIVE` in
  `parity.mjs`. A `UiElement` MUST override `TagName`, or it renders itself for ever (a stack overflow that
  kills the test process). A part that puts markup of its own around its children is a `Component`, not a
  `UiElement` (Core's serializer writes an element's children straight from the indexer) — `UiCallout`,
  `UiTable` via `HostedElement`. The one exception is `UiButton`, which stays the `<button>` and composes its
  icon, spinner and tooltip in `RenderChildren`; that takes its enclosing component off the cached-render fast
  path, so it only does it when it has such a part (plain `Ui.Button["Save"]` stays fast).
- **A new tab** is `rel="noopener noreferrer"` everywhere (`Ui.Link.External()`, `Ui.Button.NewTab()`).
- **Icons:** `Ui.Icon.Name(Ui.IconName.ChevronDown).Variant(Ui.IconVariant.Micro)` (or `.Mini`, `.Solid`) —
  never an inline SVG path. The enum is all of Heroicons, generated by `scripts/flux/icons.mjs`.
- **Classes:** complete Tailwind literals in the component (a `private static string` switch per
  enum). The `zinc` scale and `fx-accent` / `fx-accent-content` / `fx-accent-foreground` tokens
  (`src/Rask.Ui/Styles/ui.css`), `dark:` for dark. **No daisyUI class, no `base-*`, no `--color-ui-*`.**
  Never build a class by concatenation — Tailwind only emits what it can read whole.
- **CSS only when a utility cannot say it** (a keyframe, a `:has()` chain): in `ui.css` under
  `@layer rask`, keyed on the `data-ui-*` marker.
- Markup, ARIA and keyboard are part of "exactly": same element, same roles, same states.
- Follow `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/api-style.md`; XML-doc every public member in a line or two.

**Form controls** take Flux's `Label` / `Description` / `DescriptionTrailing` / `Badge` and never draw a
label themselves: implement `IUiFieldControl` (`ControlId` = `UiFieldId.Derive(Id, Bind, Label)`, `Bound` =
`Bind`) and, in `Render`, `var field = UiWithField.For(this, Label, Description, DescriptionTrailing, Badge);`
→ put `field.ControlId`, `data-ui-control` and `.Aria(field.Aria)` on the control's own element →
`return field.Wrap(control);` (a checkbox, radio or switch: `field.Wrap(control, Ui.FieldVariant.Inline, controlFirst: true)`).

**Bleed** is one contract, the card's (Flux's `--flux-bleed-*`): `Ui.Card` and `Ui.CardBody` set
`--ui-card-radius`, `--ui-bleed-x`, `--ui-bleed`, `--ui-bleed-top|bottom` and `--ui-bleed-top|bottom-radius`;
whatever bleeds (`Ui.CardBleed`, `Ui.Table.Bleed()`) only reads them, with `first:`/`last:` for the edges.
Never key on `[data-ui-card]` from another component.

## 3. Prove it
1. `tests/Rask.Ui.Tests/Flux/Parity/<Name>Parity.cs` — derive from `FluxParity`, translate EVERY
   example on Flux's page (same order, same words; section = the `<h2>` id above it). Lay out with `Row`,
   `Stack`, `SpaceY(n, …)` (Tailwind's `space-y-n`) or an inline style: a utility written in a test is in no
   sheet. A utility Flux's example hands to `class` is an APP's: state it in a `<style>` under a name of
   your own (`.parity-up{…}`) — never as `.bg-white{…}`, which unlayered would beat the kit's `dark:`.
2. Add the part to `Built` in `FluxConformanceTests`; anything that does not translate goes in
   `NotTranslated` with its reason.
3. ```bash
   dotnet test tests/Rask.Ui.Tests --filter "FullyQualifiedName~Flux"
   node scripts/flux/parity.mjs <slug>            # until: "matches Flux"
   ```
   Fix the COMPONENT until it passes. A difference is only accepted when it is Livewire-specific or
   comes from the docs page rather than the component; say which, in a comment on the example.
   Two false greens to know: a crashed `parity.mjs` prints no `FAIL` (read its last line), and
   `dotnet test` prints `Passed!` with a lower total after the test process crashed — look for
   `FATAL ERROR` / `Test Run Failed`, and compare the total with the last run.
4. Unit tests in `tests/Rask.Ui.Tests/Components/Ui<Name>Tests.cs`: behaviour and markup contract
   (roles, attributes, what a prop writes). Names are sentences; three blank-line-separated blocks.

### The harness, as it is (`scripts/flux/lib.mjs`, `parity.mjs`, `FluxParityPages.cs`)
One harness for every page. Do not patch it to pass a page; if a rule is missing, add ONE general rule
with a comment, and re-run every built page (`field heading text icon separator skeleton progress table
card accordion callout button` today).
- **The page** is the kit's sheet, then a preflight-like reset in `@layer base`. Nothing of Flux's docs
  page is hard-coded in it.
- **Inherited context** (ink, font, size, weight, line height, letter spacing) is copied from each
  example's Flux twin onto the Rask wrapper before measuring (`measurePage`'s `prepare`). Never write
  `line-height:26px` or `color:#000` into a parity class.
- **Pairing** is by marker NAME, in document order. A part the page documents (from `flux.snapshot.json`,
  or `<slug>-*`) must be there node for node. A marker from another page with NO marked node on the Rask
  side is printed as a note and not compared. `MISMARKED` corrects a root Flux marks oddly.
- **Stand-ins** for a neighbour not rebuilt yet, on the Rask node: `data-parity-skip` (held to its place
  and size, inside not compared — give it the exact measured box, to 1/64px); `="self"` (its own look is
  another component's, children compared); `="width"`/`"height"` (that dimension is `rand()` on Flux's
  page, here and below). When the real component lands, the stand-in goes: Heading, Text, Field, Label,
  Description, Icon, Separator, Table, Card, Callout, Button are real now — use them.
- **A real component inside a wrapper that is not rebuilt** (Flux's button sits in `<ui-tooltip>` or
  `<ui-dropdown>`): write the wrapper as a `<div data-ui-tooltip data-parity-skip="self">` holding the real
  component and a `display:none` `data-parity-skip` box per hidden sibling (the bubble, the menu). Without
  the marked wrapper the tool sees Flux's button under a marked ancestor and yours at the top, and the
  counts differ. See `SeparatorParity.Bar`, `TableParity.RowMenu`.
- **A colour the docs page hands a component by class** and that must lose to the component's own hover
  (`text-zinc-300` on the header's subtle button): `.parity-x:not(:hover){…}` on the page, and
  `not-hover:text-zinc-300` in an app.
- **A root Flux leaves unmarked** (`<ui-chart>` carries no `data-flux-*`) is named in `MISMARKED` by its tag.
  A `<template>` is no child on either side (Flux keeps a prototype of every chart node in one). A node in
  `EXTRA` (`data-ui-chart-hover`) is what the kit adds to do WITHOUT script what Flux does with it: not paired.
- **Not differences:** `NATIVE` tag pairs (and `button`→`summary`); the colour of a border 0px wide on
  both sides, or of an outline with `outline-style:none` on both, at rest and in a forced state; the
  offset of a node with no box (`display:none` itself or above it, or 0×0 on both sides); `oklch(… none)`
  ≡ `oklch(… 0)`; a forced state where only one side measured the node (60 per example).
- **Animations:** clock-driven CSS animations are paused at their first frame and their DEFINITION (name
  with `flux-`≡`ui-`, duration, delay, iterations, direction, fill, keyframes with easing) is recorded per
  node and compared. Scroll-driven ones are neither paused nor recorded: the kit uses one where Flux runs
  script. After any change to `lib.mjs`, cached Flux measurements are stale — `parity.mjs <slug> --refresh`.
- **Public API:** `python3 scripts/public-api/record.py src/Rask.Ui` builds and applies RS0016/RS0017 to
  both baselines (run it twice: a step exists only once its property compiles). It is the only such script.

### The chart is measured its own way (`scripts/flux/parity-chart.mjs`)
Flux's docs make chart data up on EVERY request (random values, dates counted back from now), and lay a chart
out around tick labels measured before Inter may have loaded. So **never `parity.mjs chart --refresh`**:
`node scripts/flux/parity-chart.mjs --measure` pins one load (the document is replayed for both schemes, the
charts are redrawn once the fonts are in), writes the rows each chart drew to
`tests/Rask.Ui.Tests/Flux/Parity/ChartParity.data.json` (commit it with the change) and the measurement where
`parity.mjs chart` caches it. Then `parity.mjs chart` for boxes and styles and `parity-chart.mjs` for geometry:
every number of every `d`, `x1…y2`, `cx/cy/r` and `translate()`, to 0.05px. Flux's rules were found by handing
its live `<ui-chart>` a dataset (`element.value = rows`) and reading back what it drew — the way to answer any
new question about its layout. `scripts/flux/inter-metrics.mjs` regenerates the label-width table.

## 4. Replace what it supersedes
One commit per component, the solution building throughout:
- delete the daisy-drawn component(s) it replaces and their `UiClassNames` entries and tests;
- convert every call site — `src/Rask.Site`, `src/Rask.Dashboard`, `src/Rask.DevTools`,
  `src/Rask.Site.DataDemo`, `src/Rask.Templates`, `tests/**`, `docs/**`, `README.md`, `llms.txt`;
- showcase — REQUIRED, two agents skipped it: the component's demo on the site shows every Flux example
  (`src/Rask.Site/Features/UiKit`), with its E2E; `docs/ui-kit.md`; CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]` (BREAKING where
  a name or value changed). A demo that changes structure needs the golden regenerated:
  `RASK_UPDATE_GOLDEN=1 dotnet test tests/Rask.Site.Tests --filter FullyQualifiedName~DemoMarkupGolden`;
- `src/Rask.Ui/PublicAPI/*/PublicAPI.Unshipped.txt` (both TFMs): `scripts/public-api/record.py src/Rask.Ui`.
- A bare word in the kit's SOURCES that is a daisyUI class (`divider`, `alert`, `badge`) — in a comment
  too — makes Tailwind emit that class again. Reword it.

Then the `rask-ship` gate and `land-on-main`. Screenshot the showcase demo in light and dark
(`run-rask`) before landing.

When the daily run reports that Flux moved: `flux.lock.json` is CI's, measured on its Linux runner, so
a local `node scripts/flux/sync.mjs <slug>` measures for `parity.mjs` but compares nothing. Match the
component, land it, then relock: `gh workflow run upstream.yml -f relock=true`.

## Leftovers, each to delete with what it waits for
- `UiStyles.Card` points at the default Flux surface and is still used by `UiStat`, HttpFetchDemo, GuideCards
  and PropsIdClassStyleDemo: goes with the old chrome.
- `Ui.ThemeName` / `UiTheme` / `Ui.Shell.Theme` remain for the Dashboard's light pin and three DevTools test
  apps, and go with daisyUI; then `.dark` must set `color-scheme: dark` in `ui.css`, and the OS-preference
  arm of `@custom-variant dark` goes too. `AppearanceToggle` is `Ui.Button.Subtle` now; its hand-drawn
  tooltip has a `// SEAM:` to become the button's `Tooltip`/`TooltipKbd` when `Ui.Tooltip` lands.
- Button: `UiClassNames.ButtonTone/ButtonVariant/ButtonSize` and the `.btn-*`, `.btn > svg`,
  `.btn[data-loading]` CSS stay until Popover, Dropdown, Fab, DayGrid, Filter, MultiSelect, Profile,
  Pagination, Sidebar and the templates stop writing raw `btn`. `UiButtonTooltip` is an internal stopgap
  (a child of the button shown by CSS) to be replaced by `Ui.Tooltip` when that branch merges; no parity
  page measures it. `Ui.ButtonType.Reset`, `Disabled`, `Command`/`CommandFor` are the `<button>`'s own
  attributes, kept as such, not Flux props.
- The `.alert-*` contrast corrections stay in `ui.css` for the templates' hand-written `alert alert-*`.
- The Dashboard's queue tiles lost their icon and hover (Flux's card has no link or icon props, and the
  Dashboard may not write classes): rebuilt on Flux pieces later.
- Chart: what needs a pointer hook in the runtime (a `pointermove` that re-renders with the hovered row) and has
  none today — the summary following the pointer, a pie's tooltip and its `data-active` / `data-inactive`, the
  tooltip following the pointer vertically, and re-measuring on resize (`Ui.ChartSvg.Width/Height` state the
  box instead). A pie's default hues go in palette order; Flux hashes the slice's id, by a rule not derived.
  Not built for want of an example to measure: `scale` on an axis, `tick-start="min"` / `tick-end="max"`, an X
  axis on top, the look of `axis.mark` and `zero-line` (drawn, unverified), smooth curves on a horizontal chart.
- Parity stand-ins still standing: chart page (the badges in the sparkline table), card page (fields, switches, the heading/text lines whose variant was
  not looked up, the "Password" row with its button), table page (badge, avatar, the dropdown and menu
  around the row button, pager), progress page (slider, as raw `ui-slider` markup), separator page (the
  tooltip around the theme button), callout page (one badge), field page (inputs).

## Open work (integration stopped here on 2026-10-07 — see the integrator's report)
- A stale `src/Rask.Site/obj/**/rask-external` folder can fail the site build after merging main
  (`@rask/routes` not found): delete that folder.
- The `Translations` gate in `FluxConformanceTests`, and the removals the owner's rule asks for.
- `sync.mjs` and `lib.mjs` on main changed (#1189): the lock is CI's, animations rest through
  `window.__fluxRest()`. Merge main's with this harness; keep the recording of animation definitions.
- The comparison in `parity.mjs` is not importable; open-state scripts copy it. Move it to a module.
