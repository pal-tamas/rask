# Changelog

All notable changes to Rask are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions are stamped at pack
time (`$(PackageVersion)`); this log groups changes by the pull request that introduced
them until tagged releases begin.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- `SessionUploadStore` no longer blocks a thread-pool thread with sync-over-async
  (`.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`) while staging an upload — the copy is now awaited.

### Documentation
- New [Composition](docs/composition.md) guide: children & fragments, callbacks, context,
  `Virtualize`, drag-and-drop.
- New [JS interop](docs/js-interop.md) guide: scoped CSS/JS, `IJSRuntime`, element refs,
  asset delivery.
- XML `<summary>` docs on the public host entry points (`AddRask`, `UseRask`,
  `WasmHostBuilder` / `RunAsync`).
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and this changelog.
- Per-sample and per-template `README.md` files; clearer `--auth` template descriptions.

### Changed
- Showcase sample: the home page is now a grouped feature index, with light UI polish.

## Earlier history

Condensed from the commit log; see GitHub PRs for detail.

### Authentication & security
- Production authentication: `Authorize` component, route guards, cookie & JWT for Server
  and WASM, runnable samples, templates and the [authentication guide](docs/authentication.md) (#33).
- Hardened the live session: `returnUrl` handling, WebSocket origin checks, reconnect race
  fix, and a concurrent-session cap (#34).

### Components & DX
- Replaced the `Callback` type with automatic generator-managed parent re-render (#31),
  building on Context, element refs, form groups, and user-gating (#30).
- Added a headless drag-and-drop primitive (#26) and typed SVG components with a showcase (#16).
- Made non-nullable value-type factory parameters required (#25).
- First-class `Component.Key` with auto-forward and the RASK022 missing-key warning (#7).
- Emit `[DebuggerStepThrough]` + a `<see cref>` breadcrumb on generated factories (#35).

### Live runtime & diff codec
- `PermutationBatch` diff op to close the keyed-reorder byte soft spot (#20).
- Pooled the keyed-diff scratch so `FrameDiffer` is allocation-free per session (#17).
- Ship a `<head>` fragment / history-only diff on head- or query-only navigations.

### Infrastructure
- Restructured to `src` / `tests` / `samples` / `benchmarks` with `.slnx` and Central
  Package Management (#14).
- Consolidated shared test helpers into `Rask.TestSupport` (#4).
