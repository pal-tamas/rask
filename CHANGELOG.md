# Changelog

All notable changes to Rask are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions are stamped at pack
time (`$(PackageVersion)`); this log groups changes by the pull request that introduced
them until tagged releases begin.

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- URL-bearing attributes (`href`, `src`, `cite`, `formaction`, object `data`, `poster`,
  SVG `href`) are now **scheme-sanitized by default**: `javascript:`/`vbscript:` and
  `data:` outside media tags are neutralized to `about:blank`, closing a DOM-XSS hole that
  HTML-encoding alone left open. Detection defeats whitespace/tab/NUL obfuscation. Opt out
  per call with `RaskUrl.Trusted(...)` for URLs you control; media tags still allow inline
  `data:image/*`, `data:video/*`, `data:audio/*`. See the [getting-started guide](docs/getting-started.md#url-attributes-are-scheme-sanitized).

### Performance
- Scoped-asset registry reads (run per component, per render) are now lock-free
  (`ConcurrentDictionary`), so concurrent sessions no longer serialize on a process-wide lock.
- Removed `AsyncLocal` reads from the per-element attribute path via a thread-local
  render-context mirror, and cache `Component.Key` stringification (no per-render `ToString`
  allocation on keyed lists).
- `<head>` splice avoids a second whole-body scan, pools its builders, and appends keys
  without per-asset string allocation.

### Memory
- The per-render head-asset collector and mounted-type set are hoisted onto the root and
  reused (cleared per render) instead of allocating fresh collections every frame.
- A session minted by the GET shell but never connected over WebSocket is now evicted on a
  short grace (vs. the 30s reconnect grace), and `MaxSessions` is enforced as a hard atomic
  reservation — a concurrent GET burst can no longer exceed the cap.
- The WebSocket handler-dispatch chain is bounded: when handlers back up behind a hung or
  flooding client, the socket is closed instead of retaining queued payloads without limit.

### Changed
- **CI is now parallel.** The single build-then-test job is split into a fast `unit` gate
  (every non-browser test, built without the WASM AppBundle) and an `e2e` job that **shards
  one browser host per runner** so all fixtures boot concurrently instead of in serial
  batches. PR feedback no longer waits on the full E2E suite.
- **E2E suite is being consolidated** to a single comprehensive journey per hosting project
  (walk every page, exercise every browser-observable feature, plus unusual activity —
  refresh, back/forward, offline→reconnect, slow-3G). Framework/component logic that the
  in-process harness can cover is moving into the unit projects (unit-first).

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-10

### Fixed
- `SessionUploadStore` no longer blocks a thread-pool thread with sync-over-async
  (`.GetAwaiter().GetResult()`) while staging an upload — the copy is now awaited.

### Documentation
- New [Composition](docs/composition.md) guide: children & fragments, callbacks, context,
  `Virtualize`, drag-and-drop.
- New [JS interop](docs/js-interop.md) guide: scoped CSS/JS, `IJSRuntime`, element refs,
  asset delivery.
- XML `<summary>` docs on the public host entry points (`AddRask`, `UseRask`,
  `WasmHostBuilder` / `RunAsync`).
- Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` and this changelog.
- Per-sample and per-template `README.md` files; clearer `--auth` template descriptions.

### Changed
- Showcase sample: the home page is now a grouped feature index, with light UI polish.

## Earlier history

Condensed from the commit log; see GitHub PRs for detail.

### Authentication & security
- Production authentication: `Authorize` component, route guards, cookie & JWT for Server
  and WASM, runnable samples, templates and the [authentication guide](docs/authentication.md) (#33).
- Hardened the live session: `returnUrl` handling, WebSocket origin checks, reconnect race
  fix, and a concurrent-session cap (#34).

### Components & DX
- Replaced the `Callback` type with automatic generator-managed parent re-render (#31),
  building on Context, element refs, form groups, and user-gating (#30).
- Added a headless drag-and-drop primitive (#26) and typed SVG components with a showcase (#16).
- Made non-nullable value-type factory parameters required (#25).
- First-class `Component.Key` with auto-forward and the RASK022 missing-key warning (#7).
- Emit `[DebuggerStepThrough]` + a `<see cref>` breadcrumb on generated factories (#35).

### Live runtime & diff codec
- `PermutationBatch` diff op to close the keyed-reorder byte soft spot (#20).
- Pooled the keyed-diff scratch so `FrameDiffer` is allocation-free per session (#17).
- Ship a `<head>` fragment / history-only diff on head- or query-only navigations.

### Infrastructure
- Restructured to `src` / `tests` / `samples` / `benchmarks` with `.slnx` and Central
  Package Management (#14).
- Consolidated shared test helpers into `Rask.TestSupport` (#4).
